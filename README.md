# Filling-the-Gap

Filling-the-Gap (FG) tool is a tool for continuous performance model parametrization. The FG tool implements a set of statistical estimation algorithms to parameterize performance models from runtime monitoring data. Multiple algorithms are included, allowing for alternative ways to obtain estimates for different metrics, but with an emphasis on resource demand estimation. 

# Versions
* FG has been initially developed in the [MODAClouds](http://www.modaclouds.eu) project. [Download](projects/modaclouds)
* An improved version is under development within the [DICE](http://www.dice-h2020.eu) project. [Download](https://github.com/dice-project/DICE-Enhancement-FG)
