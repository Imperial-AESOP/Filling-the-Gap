# Filling-the-Gap

Filling-the-Gap (FG) tool is a tool for continuous performance model parametrization. The FG tool implements a set of statistical estimation algorithms to parameterize performance models from runtime monitoring data. Multiple algorithms are included, allowing for alternative ways to obtain estimates for different metrics, but with an emphasis on resource demand estimation. 

# Versions
* FG has been initially developed as part of the FP7 project [MODAClouds| http://www.modaclouds.eu], the corresponding release can be found under *project/modaclouds*.
* A new version is under development as part of the Horizon2020 project [DICE| http://www.dice-h2020.eu], the current unstable release can be found under *project/dice*
