# Filling-the-Gap

Filling-the-Gap (FG) tool is a tool for continuous performance model parametrization. The FG tool implements a set of statistical estima-
tion algorithms to parameterize performance models from runtime monitoring data. Multiple algorithms are included, allowing for alternative ways to obtain estimates for different metrics, but with an emphasis on resource demand estimation. FG tool supports advanced algorithms to estimate parameters based on response times and queue length data, which makes the tool useful in particular for applications running in virtualized environments where utilization readings are not always available.
